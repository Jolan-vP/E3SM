     The Extreme-Scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S) is accessible via the
Spack package manager.

     In order to access the production stack, you will need to load a spack
environment. Here are some tips to get started:


     'spack env list' - List all Spack environments
     'spack env activate gcc' - Activate the "gcc" Spack environment
     'spack env status' - Display the active Spack environment
     'spack load amrex' - Load the "amrex" Spack package into your user
environment
